          <p>
            This portfolio website is created using ReactJS. This is a
            responsive website which supports all devices and also includes
            particles, transitions and animations.

          <h6>Duration : 1 month (03/2021 - 03/2021)</h6>
          <p>
            The overall objective of the system is to detect the infected leaf
            of plant in a short period of time. The proposed system will use a
            custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether the
            given image of plant leaf is affected by disease or not.

            To start learning about machine learning, I decided to do an
            existing project called Real Time Object Detection. So that I can
            get practical knowledge about Machine Learning.

            It is a text editor like notepad with all shortcut options. It was
            created with python (TKinter â€“ GUI development library) which helps
            to edit text with less size of memory and the size of this text
            editor is too small when compared to other text editors.
